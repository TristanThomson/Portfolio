                        <p>For most people the link between technology and climate change is limited to spreading awareness about the subject eg. (http://www.wired.co.uk/article/climate-symphony-data-sonification). Although it is already a step in the right direction, general consensus tends to be that is isn’t enough. It is time to look behind the curtains to discover what help is technology really offering to solve this problem?
                        THE KEY QUESTION IS
                        BLAH BLAH BLAH many people are throwing the idea that ai could somehow help us in this fight to save our planet … … how good is it? How far has it come? what is it really doing? 
                        Anyone could see the negative aspect of computing on the situation our planet is going through (massive energy consumption, not always renewable sources; massive production of heat, need for cooling; hardware waste, make it more recyclable?; …) Do the positives outweigh the negatives?
                        (environmental tech is to monitor, model, conserve nature and it’s resources as well as curb the human impact eg. Photovoltaics, … )
                        As everyone is pushing to reduce emissions, ultimately achieving carbon neutrality…
                        TRANSPARENCY
                        Smaller, more local, more meaningful steps… (https://www.techrepublic.com/article/10-ways-technology-is-fighting-climate-change/) even as simple as reducing food waste.
                        Instead of carbon-neutrality country-wide, why not carbon neutrality in smaller scale in companies? Possibility of including competition into the mix, to tap in to our natural instinct?
                        Not just in their buildings and offices, but also in the resources those infrastructures need to stay running.
                        DATACENTRES
                        Cleaner energy?
                        How does the cooling for computers work?
                        Recycling hardware? Building hardware to be recycled? Non-renewable resources used…
                        AI – intro about new things about it in 2017
                            Increase energy efficiency+ disturbing nature as little as possible (https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2999/how-could-ai-impact-climate-change)
                            Use of AI to process all the data coming from earth scientists.
                                Predicting natural disasters.

                        Great hope for the possibilities of AI in the domain of repertoire-ing species and conserving biodiversity by making data accessible to the people that can act on it.
