    <p class="questions">Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement.</p>
        <p>I chose a one-page structure for my portfolio website to provide a quick insight into myself and my abilities. I also have another page for more detail on my projects and one to display in-depth thoughts about a subject. I went for a simpler design because of my lack of experience in web design.</p>

    <p class="questions">State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.</p>
    
        <p>I was inspired by modern design for it’s simplicity and effectiveness. I have tried to re-create this in a fashion that suits my content as best as possible.</p>
        <p>In terms of content, I wanted to use a friendly approach towards my potential visitors without lacking depth in the information I shared. For this, I was insired by Casey Neistat and Jonathan Patterson's website [1].</p>
        <p>I imagined the navbar and layout of the two secondary pages after reading articles on medium.com .</p>

    <p class="questions">State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</p>
        <p>I used h1, h2, p, etc. for appropriate content.
        I used distinct colour contrast between adjacent elements as well as styling elements distinctly for emphasis.
        I didn’t forget my alt tags on the pictures. 
        </p>

    <p class="questions">State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site. </p>
        <p>The mailto: e-mail link in the contact section only on mobile, as most mobile users have their e-mail accounts linked to the mail app on their device.
        An easily understandable layout for the whole website, along with differently styled links depending on where the mouse is positioned.
        Same-page anchor links that scroll to said element (replacing the default behaviour of those links). [2]
        </p>

    <p class="questions">State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).</p>
        <p>I found the CSS display property surprisingly useful. As soon as I started understanding how to use it thanks to examples and online resources [3], it became a valuable tool for laying out my design (I had been told by a friend to always use absolute, which turned out being a terrible idea!).</p>
        <p>I also wanted to use jQuery as the only scripting language, hoping to get familiar with it. I am glad to say that I now understand the syntax enough to do simple things using it. I grew familiar with the library using w3schools’ tutorial on jQuery [4]</p>
        <p>This was my first time doing a responsive layout on a website. I had to learn to use media queries to achieve this effect. I was worried it might be more of a process than it actually was.
        </p>

    <p class="questions">What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why? </p>
        <p>I’m happy with the final design of my site. Although I feel it’s a bit classic, it resembles the idea I had of my website as closely as possible. The implementation of JavaScript is also a highlight, it doesn’t add anything major but makes the experience more comfortable. I’m particularly proud of my header because of the layout, responsiveness and clarity of it. I had to use a CSS background image for this and other properties to set it in the right position.</p>

    <p class="questions">What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</p>
    <p>I will definitely consider the mobile layout more in advance. I think it lacks a bit of colour and depth. Should I consider significantly altering the design between platforms? After reading an article about CSS units<a href="https://web-design-weekly.com/2014/11/18/viewport-units-vw-vh-vmin-vmax/">(https://web-design-weekly.com/2014/11/18/viewport-units-vw-vh-vmin-vmax/)</a>, I want to try using only measuring units that aren’t pixels (vh, vw, %, etc.). I think this might make the website more responsive by itself. </p>

    <p class="questions">What resources were used when creating your work? You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts. </p>
